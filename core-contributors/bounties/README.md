# Bounties

**The Tellor Bounties program** is a way to reward developers who help us build out Tellor and is funded from a portion of Tellor's dev-share.   As a decentralized protocol with no admin key, it's important that Tellor grows more and more community driven.  A robust community of contributors makes us stronger.  This is the reason our motto is **We Are Tellor**.
